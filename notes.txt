Structure


menu.py files
-> define a function in the file which will act as the code to run when switching to that menu
-> handle inputs, print messages, do everything inside of this file
-> all menu.py files should return either a menu name (to move to) or "back"
    -> if the string "back" is returned, the code will handle it and move back one menu in the history
